# Deploying a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure

## Introduction
In this guide, we will walk through the steps to deploy a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure. A VNet is a fundamental building block for any Azure infrastructure deployment, as it provides isolation and segmentation of resources.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- An Azure subscription
- Sufficient permissions to create resources in Azure

## Steps

### Step 1: Sign in to the Azure portal
1. Open a web browser and navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Sign in with your Azure account credentials.

### Step 2: Create a new Virtual Network
1. In the Azure portal, click on the **Create a resource** button.
2. Search for "Virtual Network" and select the **Virtual Network** option from the search results.
3. Click on the **Create** button to start the creation process.
4. Provide a unique name for the VNet and select the desired subscription, resource group, and region.
5. Configure the IP address range and subnet settings according to your requirements.
6. Review the other settings and click on the **Create** button to create the VNet.

### Step 3: Verify the VNet deployment
1. Once the VNet deployment is complete, navigate to the **Virtual networks** section in the Azure portal.
2. Select the newly created VNet from the list.
3. Verify that the VNet details and settings match your configuration.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure. You can now start connecting other Azure resources to this VNet to build your infrastructure.

## Next Steps
- Connect a virtual machine to the VNet
- Configure network security groups and routing
- Explore advanced VNet features like peering and VPN gateways
